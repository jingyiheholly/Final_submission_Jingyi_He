# AI in Vision-Language Models for Medical Imaging

This repository contains my work for the seminar **"AI in Vision-Language Models in Medical Imaging"**.

## 📁 Structure

The code in this repository supports two main application areas in medical imaging:
- **Chest X-ray analysis** using the **Maira-2** vision-language model
- **Brain MRI interpretation** using **HuatuoGPT-Vision**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Download the datasets

Please download the corresponding datasets for:

- Chest X-ray images (for **Maira-2**)
- Brain MRI images (for **HuatuoGPT-Vision**)

Then place the datasets under the following directory:

```bash
~/code/data/
```

The directory structure should look like:

```
~/code/data/
├── chest_xray/      # X-ray images for Maira-2
└── brain_mri/       # MRI images for HuatuoGPT-Vision
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Make sure to install required packages (preferably in a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Maira-2**: A Vision-Language Model optimized for chest X-ray interpretation.
- **HuatuoGPT-Vision**: A medical vision-language model applied here for brain MRI tasks.

## 💡 Notes

- This code is intended for academic use in the context of the seminar.
- Ensure that you comply with dataset license terms before downloading and using any data.
